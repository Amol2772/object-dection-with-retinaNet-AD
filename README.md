# Introduction 

Object detection a very important problem in computer vision. Here the model is tasked with localizing the objects present in an image, and at the same time, classifying them into different categories.

Object detection models can be broadly classified into "single-stage" and "two-stage" detectors. Two-stage detectors are often more accurate but at the cost of being slower.
